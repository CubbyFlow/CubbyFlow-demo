# CubbyFlow - Demo

<b>IMPORTANT: This repository is forked from [fluid-engine-dev-demo](https://github.com/doyubkim/fluid-engine-dev-demo) that was created by [Doyub Kim](https://twitter.com/doyub).</b>

This directory contains example scene files that I used for generating [CubbyFlow Framework demo](https://utilforever.github.io/CubbyFlow-v0/Examples/). The scene files are based on [Mitsuba 0.5.0](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org). For more details about the schema itself, please refer to the Mitsuba documentation. This repository also contains sample simulation outputs unders `Datas` directory. Those are all generated using [the example apps](https://github.com/utilForever/CubbyFlow-v0/tree/master/Examples) accompanied with CubbyFlow framework.

Any contributions to this repository are welcome. Also, it should not be limited by Mitsuba renderer, but rendering the data with other (open source, if possible) renderers would be very interesting.
